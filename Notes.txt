# /node_modules in .gitignore file -> will only ignore node_modules in current directory(means '/')
-> if we want to avoid all node_modules(even in backend and other folders if there)
-> we need to update it to "node_modules" insted of "/node_modules"


# Cors-Cross Origin Resource Sharing 
must be used to mention the backend -> from which url or addresses you can accept requests


# e.preventDefault() blocks the default nature of selected component
-> for example on click a button refreshes the page 
-> in order to prevent this behaviour you can use preventDefault


# place edit model in parent component
-> make launch demo model display none
-> use useRef's to manage clicks of toggle(hidden launch demo button)
-> and pass update function to toggle button(launch demo button) and get details of that particular note
as a prop to each child note

-> final setup -> function to update and model code in parent component and just fucntion call is done
from child component as we have passed this function to each child as a prop.

# scroll to note fucnction :-

-> pass ref to each note while iterating in map funciton -> with some unique ref to each note
-> here we have done like this he syntax noteRef={(el) => noteRefs.current[note._id] = el} 
   is used to dynamically assign a ref to a specific DOM element for each note,
   allowing you to access and manipulate the DOM nodes directly in React functional components.
-> The syntax (el) => noteRefs.current[note._id] = el is a callback ref. It takes the DOM element (el) rendered by the component
   and stores it in the noteRefs.current object with the key as the noteâ€™s unique _id.
-> el refers to the actual DOM element
->For example, if the note has an _id of 123,
 then the corresponding DOM element will be stored as noteRefs.current['123'].
 -> this is how they are stored 
 
 -> (note's id --- DOM of that note)
 current
: 
66f83b1db7bd5ca582ec0993: div.col-md-3
66f988e43b5cf95c453d991c: div.col-md-3 and soo onnnnn.....

-> note's id and corresponding DOM element of that note is stored in noteRefs object
