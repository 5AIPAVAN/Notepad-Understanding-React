# /node_modules in .gitignore file -> will only ignore node_modules in current directory(means '/')
-> if we want to avoid all node_modules(even in backend and other folders if there)
-> we need to update it to "node_modules" insted of "/node_modules"


# Cors-Cross Origin Resource Sharing 
must be used to mention the backend -> from which url or addresses you can accept requests


# e.preventDefault() blocks the default nature of selected component
-> for example on click a button refreshes the page 
-> in order to prevent this behaviour you can use preventDefault


# place edit model in parent component
-> make launch demo model display none
-> use useRef's to manage clicks of toggle(hidden launch demo button)
-> and pass update function to toggle button(launch demo button) and get details of that particular note
as a prop to each child note

-> final setup -> function to update and model code in parent component and just fucntion call is done
from child component as we have passed this function to each child as a prop.
